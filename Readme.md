# Mudkip

    A Big Blog of Mud. Exploring ideas to improve Coleslaw as a spirtiual fork. Extending it to a static-site generator, supporting dynamic content generator and discarding the git backend.

# Goals

    - To be a big ball of mud easily moldable into your content specific needs(?!).
    - Self hosting documentation built and deployed to gh through travis.
    - Easy to contribute by 'pull requests'.

# Non Goals cool stuff to explore

    - Use libgit2 for kicks.
    - Per document injection.
