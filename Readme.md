# Mudkip

    A Big Blog of Mud. It aspires to be the last static site generation *library* you will ever need. It started out as an exploration on how could Coleslaw be improved. Supports dynamic content generation.

# Goals

    - To be a big ball of mud easily moldable into your content specific needs(?!).
    - Self hosting documentation built and deployed to gh through travis-ci.
    - Easy to contribute by 'pull requests'.

# Non Goals cool stuff to explore

    - Use libgit2 for kicks.
    - Per document injection.
